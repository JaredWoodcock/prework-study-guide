# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to create a tool for myself to help me be successful during my Bootcamp Prework.
I built this project so that I could have a spot to store my notes and help myself with studying. 
This project helps keep all of my material for this course in one spot, while also keeping it separate from anything else. 
I learned a lot of valuable information including things like HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
